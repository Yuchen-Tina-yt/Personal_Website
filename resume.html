        <li><b>Lord of Feuds Game (Software Engineering, Functional Programming) [2019]</b></li>
        Developed a game called Lord of Feuds using OCaml in a group of 4. The game resembles the classical
        Monopoly game but differ in many ways. I was responsible for
        developing the two random systems, the chance card system and the lottery system, that makes the game more
        unpredictable.
        The chance card system is similar to that of the Monopoly game; the player is randomly given a chance card. The
        lottery system,
        however, is more interesting and unpredictable. It could give you Good and Bad things,
        and you have to think carefully before you take this lottery option--SERIOUSLY.
        I was also responsible for building the Game Engine that handles the whole game.
        We were our own Project Managers; as a team, we worked together to set milestones,
        evaluate performance, and give our work
        a score according to which scope we have accomplished.
