          Welcome to my Personal Website! <br><br>
          I'm a Financial Engineering master student at Columbia University. Guided by my strong passion in Quant
          Finance, I've done many projects and internships related to this field. Details are mentioned in intro
          section. <br>
          Previously, I'm an undergraduate at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science
          and minoring in Operations Research and Management Science. I graduated in three years with latin honors.<br>
          I'm interested in dealing with quantitative and technical issues.
          Applying quantitative methods to gain insights from financial markets always excites me.<br> <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently interning at TheStock.AI and building a reinforcement learning trading bot using deep Q
          learning.<br>
          I'm currently an undregraduate researcher of Quant Finance and NLP.
          <br>
          Previously, I worked as a consultant for Functional Programming and for Python programming.<br>
          ***I'm currently re-writing my personal website using javascript. The approximate launch time of the (fancy)
          version is next week. The new version takes more time than I expected, but it will be **a lot** fancier than
          the current version, I promise :)<br>
